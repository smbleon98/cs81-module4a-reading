1. What was the most helpful aspect of this code’s structure?
- Even though most of the code is grouped into functions, it was organized in the procedural programming format, where the output of one function was directly used in the next function's inputs.

2. What part was confusing or took longer to understand?
- For me, I didn't understand this syntax, specifically how a value could be used in a Boolean fashion to check if it's in the list of books or not. 
        if (!bookCounts[entry.book]) {        
            bookCounts[entry.book] = 1;   
I only understood what the code was doing because of the rest of the code after it (specifically the counter++), where it became clear to me that this was a validation addressing the case where the book did not already exist.

Additionally, I know that I would not have understood the maxCount definition, either, if I hadn't learned this manual approach to identifying the maxCount in C++ prior.
